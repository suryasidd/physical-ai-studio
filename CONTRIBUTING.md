# Contributing to Physical AI Studio

## Getting Started

This is a monorepo with three main components:

| Component                    | Location               | Documentation                                    | Description                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Library** (VLA framework)  | `library/`             | [library/README.md](./library/README.md)         | Core vision-language-action policy framework   |
| **Backend** (FastAPI server) | `application/backend/` | [application/README.md](./application/README.md) | API server built on top of the library         |
| **Frontend** (React UI)      | `application/ui/`      | [application/README.md](./application/README.md) | Web interface for interacting with the backend |

The library is standalone, while the application (backend + frontend) provides a GUI on top of it.

Each project has its own virtual environment, dependencies, and setup instructions.

## Code Quality

We use [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) (Rust-based pre-commit) for code quality hooks.

### Install prek

```bash
# Using cargo
cargo install prek

# Or using the install script
curl -fsSL https://prek.j178.dev/install.sh | sh
```

### Install Git Hooks

```bash
prek install
```

### Run Hooks Manually

```bash
# All files
prek run --all-files

# Library only
prek run --all-files library/

# Backend only
prek run --all-files application/backend/

# Staged files (default)
prek run
```

## Commit Messages

Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - new features
- `fix:` - bug fixes
- `docs:` - documentation changes
- `refactor:` - code refactoring
- `test:` - adding tests
- `chore:` - maintenance tasks

Write clear, concise messages. Reference issue numbers when applicable.

## Pull Requests

- Follow conventional commit format for PR title
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Provide usage examples for new features
- Note any breaking changes

## Coding Standards

See [docs/development/coding-standards.md](./docs/development/coding-standards.md) for repo-wide coding standards.

For `library/` code, also follow [library/docs/development/security.md](./library/docs/development/security.md).

## Sign Your Work

Please use the sign-off line at the end of the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

```

    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
