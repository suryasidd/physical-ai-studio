## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install physicalai-train

# Train
physicalai fit --config configs/physicalai/act.yaml

# Benchmark
physicalai benchmark \
    --benchmark physicalai.benchmark.gyms.LiberoBenchmark \
    --policy physicalai.policies.ACT \
    --ckpt_path ./checkpoints/model.ckpt

# Export
policy.export("./exports", backend="openvino")
```

`physicalai-train` depends on the runtime package, which owns the top-level
`physicalai` executable. Studio contributes training and benchmark subcommands via
entry points, so the user-facing commands stay the same.

## Pyrefly baseline

The library uses a Pyrefly baseline file (`pyrefly-baseline.json`) to track known
existing type-check errors while still failing on newly introduced issues.

Common commands from the `library/` directory:

```bash
# Run Pyrefly with the configured baseline
uv run pyrefly check -c pyproject.toml

# Regenerate/update the baseline after intentional typing changes
uv run pyrefly check -c pyproject.toml --baseline="pyrefly-baseline.json" --update-baseline
```

When updating the baseline, include a short note in your PR explaining why the
baseline changed and which error categories were added or removed.
